## Plan

### 1. Presentation

- Write your CV.
- Update your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles with latest information. Make sure it is consistent with the CV.

### 2. Preparation Plan

#### 2.1. Coding + Algorithms

- Main Task #1: Solve a set of ~50 LeetCode questions, with easy/medium/hard distribution of ~10/20/20.
  - Good resource: _Cracking the Coding Interview_ book.
- Main Task #2: Go through the most popular algorithms / patterns:
  - Conversion of recursive algorithms to iterative algorithms.
  - Various sorting algorithms (selection, insertion, quick, ...).
  - Backtracking algorithms (e.g. N-Queens problem).
  - Search / selection algorithms (binary search, QuickSelect, greedy search).
  - Binary heap buildout (top-k elements group of problems).
  - Matrix operations (multiplication, rotation, transposition, ...).
  - Linked list operations.
  Binary tree operations (traversal, lookup, inversion, ...).
  - Graphs - DFS, BFS and topological sorting.
  - Map / trie trees (common strings group of problems).
  - Matrix / grid operations for search of "islands".
  - Dynamic programming.
  - Greedy algorithms.
  - Divide and Conquer algorithms.
- Side Task #1: C++
  - Go over syntax to catch up on forgotten details.
  - Research most commonly used APIs from STL.
  - Good resource: _Effective STL_ book.
- Side Task #2: Explore some of the common patterns:
  - Top K elements.
  - Merge K sorted collections.
  - Two heaps - use two heaps to track median or balance elements in a stream.
  - Sliding window median - calculate median in a sliding window.
  - Scheduling - manage tasks or invervals using a heap for efficient scheduling.

#### 2.2. System Design / System Programming

TBD.

#### 2.3. Architecture Design

TBD.

#### 2.4. Cross-functional / Behavioral

TBD.
